<p align="justify"> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for building platform-independent applications. Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, and now owned by Oracle Corporation, Java's "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy allows code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is known for its simplicity, portability, and robustness. It supports key programming paradigms like object-oriented, multithreading, and functional programming. Commonly used for web development, mobile apps (especially Android), enterprise software, and large-scale systems, Java's extensive libraries and frameworks make it a versatile choice for developers. </p>
